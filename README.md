# Rudimentary Backup

## Introduction
Rudimentary Backup is a Python console application meant as a simple, minimalistic solution for backup of personal data.

## Runtime Environment, Source Code Organization etc.
When implementing the project, I used Python 3.10, so this version or any higher version should work properly. Chances are older versions will work as well, but I have not tried. The application depends on these 3rd party modules:
* [pyaml](https://pypi.org/project/pyaml)
* [rich](https://pypi.org/project/rich)

## Configuration
The application is configured via a YAML file.

```yaml
```

## How to Run the Application
